## Requirements

## Build and run

Either grab one of the releases or clone the repository to your local machine. Make sure you’ve already installed Visual Studio 2017 and the latest UWP SDKs.

Once you have them, it’s pretty easy to run the app. Just build the app package or deploy it on your device within Visual Studio. Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/start-a-debugging-session-for-a-store-app-in-visual-studio-vb-csharp-cpp-and-xaml?view=vs-2017) for assistance.

You may want to configure some settings first. Right click on the `>` button in the “Donate” tab and hit `Settings`. You’ll be asked for your device PIN first. Restart the app after applying your settings to see the changes.
